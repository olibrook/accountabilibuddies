## Roadmap

#### Private Tracks

Some folks are embarrassed about the things they are logging. Support private
tracks:

- If users are following each other, they can view each others PUBLIC tracks ONLY.
- No users can ever see each others private tracks.

#### Setting up custom habits

- Should allow for different types (eg. numeric, boolean)
- Should allow you to write a little piece of text about your
  motivations/goals.

#### Schedules

#### Score-keeping

#### Groups

We can't just show the stats for everyone you follow - the UI doesn't
really work. So, instead, let users create groups that they add a small
number of friends to.

#### Emotionally engaging :star: buttons

#### User profiles

#### Public-facing views of user profiles

Make these shareable/embeddable and branded.

- Support HTML embed
- Support JPEG/whatver embed ‚Äì think about folks sharing in Slack, etc.
